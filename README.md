# OpenAL-Ada-GUI-Doppler-Effect-1-Linear
A GUI Ada application that demonstrates the Doppler effect using OpenAL-Ada

**1. Tone Audio Doppler Effect Demo**

You can listen to the Doppler effect as a 1000 Hz tone source moves from left to right or right to left relative to the listener.
As the source moves, the audio frequency shifts according to the Doppler effect, and you can hear the sound transition from your left ear to your right ear.

**2. Passing Train Sound Doppler Effect Demo**

This demo reproduces the sound of a passing train as if you were standing near a railroad crossing.
Similar to the tone demo, you can hear both the change in audio frequency due to movement and the shift in volume from left to right as the train passes.
The duration of the sound is adjusted based on the train’s length.
